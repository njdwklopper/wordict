# wordict
Word Game JSON Dictionary creator.

The Point of these scripts is to create data for my word games instead of generating on the fly.
This would increase performance significantly (even if it doesn't minute), makes it less error prone and more testable.
Also, learning Python is damn fun, and that's probably the main excuse anyways :D
